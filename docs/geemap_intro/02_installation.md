## Install from PyPI

**Geemap** is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geemap/). To install **geemap**, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
    pip install geemap
```

## Install from conda-forge

**Geemap** is also available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/geemap). If you have
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your computer, you can install geemap using the following command:

```bash
    conda install geemap -c conda-forge
```

The geemap package has some optional dependencies, such as [geopandas](https://geopandas.org) and [localtileserver](https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver). These optional dependencies can be challenging to install on some computers, especially Windows. It is highly recommended that you create a fresh conda environment to install geopandas and geemap. Follow the commands below to set up a conda env and install geemap, geopandas, and localtileserver.

```bash
    conda create -n gee python=3.9
    conda activate gee
    conda install geopandas
    conda install geemap localtileserver -c conda-forge
```

All the optional dependencies are listed in [requirements_dev.txt](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap/blob/master/requirements_dev.txt), which can be installed using one of the following:

- `pip install geemap[all]`: installing all optional dependencies listed in [requirements_dev.txt](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap/blob/master/requirements_dev.txt).
- `pip install geemap[backends]`: installing keplergl, pydeck.
- `pip install geemap[lidar]`: installing ipygany, ipyvtklink, laspy, panel, pyntcloud[LAS], pyvista.
- `pip install geemap[raster]`: installing localtileserver, rio-cogeo, rioxarray, netcdf4, xarray_leaflet.
- `pip install geemap[sql]`: installing psycopg2, sqlalchemy.
- `pip install geemap[streamlit]`: installing streamlit-folium.
- `pip install geemap[vector]`: installing geopandas, osmnx.


Optionally, you can install some [Jupyter notebook extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions), which can improve your productivity in the notebook environment. Some useful extensions include Table of Contents, Gist-it, Autopep8, Variable Inspector, etc. See this [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231) for more information.

```bash
    conda install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions -c conda-forge
```
