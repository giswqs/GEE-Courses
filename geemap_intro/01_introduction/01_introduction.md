## Introduction

**Geemap** is a Python package for interactive mapping with [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) (GEE), which is a cloud computing platform with a [multi-petabyte catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/) of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. During the past few years, GEE has become very popular in the geospatial community and it has empowered numerous environmental applications at local, regional, and global scales. GEE provides both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers. Compared with the comprehensive [documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) and interactive IDE (i.e., [GEE JavaScript Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/)) of the GEE JavaScript API, the GEE Python API has relatively little documentation and limited functionality for visualizing results interactively. The geemap Python package was created to fill this gap. It is built upon [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) and [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets), and enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively within a Jupyter-based environment.

**Geemap** is intended for students and researchers, who would like to utilize the Python ecosystem of diverse libraries and tools to explore Google Earth Engine. It is also designed for existing GEE users who would like to transition from the GEE JavaScript API to Python API. The automated JavaScript-to-Python [conversion module](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap/blob/master/geemap/conversion.py) of the geemap package can greatly reduce the time needed to convert existing GEE JavaScripts to Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
