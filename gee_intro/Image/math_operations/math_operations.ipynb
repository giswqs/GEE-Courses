    "Earth Engine supports many basic mathematical operators. They share some common features. Earth Engine performs math operations per pixel. When an operator is applied to an image, it's applied to each unmasked pixel of each band. In the case of operations on two images, the operation is only applied at the locations where pixels in both images are unmasked. Earth Engine automatically matches bands between images. When an operator is applied to two images, the images are expected to have the same number of bands so they can be matched pairwise. However, if one of the images has only a single band, it is matched with all of the bands in the other image, essentially replicating that band enough times to match the other image."
